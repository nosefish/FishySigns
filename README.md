FishySigns
===========
A plugin for [CanaryRecode](http://www.canarymod.net) that provides an engine for CraftBook-like interactive signs.

Collections of signs can be added as jar files in the plugins/fishysigns directory. Currently, only [debug signs](https://github.com/nosefish/DebugFishySigns) exist. I have planned to create collections that duplicate most of the functionality found in [CraftBook](http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/CraftBook) and [CraftBook-Extra](http://cbx.m4411k4.com/wiki/CraftBook_extra) to facilitate migration of exisiting worlds. I will also publish a collection of my own design with a (hopefully) more consistent user experience.

Dependencies

All library jars go into the <code>lib</code> directory.
