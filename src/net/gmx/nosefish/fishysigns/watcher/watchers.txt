- Watchers are PluginListener singletons with a static initializer.
  In that static initializer, they must add themselves to the plugin.
  Outside the plugin class, they must be accessed by their static getInstance method.

- Watchers must not retain references to Activatables.
  All access to Activatables must be done via their id through the ActivationManager.

- Watchers should create FishyTasks that run outside the server thread for the activation.
  FishySigns will likely perform tasks on the activation call, so it may take a considerable
  amount of time for it to return. Make sure not to block registration by locks for too long!
